# AOC-2021
Advent of Code 2021

Will I finish every challenge? Probably not! But I hope to learn some cool C++ stuff along the way.

## Goals
- Learn more about structuring a C++ project using CMake
- Become more familiar with the C++ STL

I also hope to not shoe-horn STL usage into my code and strike a meaningful balance in that regard.
